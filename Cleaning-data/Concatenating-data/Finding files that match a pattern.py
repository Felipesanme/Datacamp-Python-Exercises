#  You're now going to practice using the glob module to find all csv files in the workspace. 
# In the next exercise, you'll programmatically load them into DataFrames.

# Import necessary modules
import glob
import pandas as pd

# Write the pattern: pattern
pattern = '*.csv'

# Save all file matches: csv_files
csv_files = glob.glob(pattern)

# Print the file names
print(csv_files)

# Load the second file into a DataFrame: csv2
csv2 = pd.read_csv(csv_files[1])

# Print the head of csv2
print(csv2.head())
