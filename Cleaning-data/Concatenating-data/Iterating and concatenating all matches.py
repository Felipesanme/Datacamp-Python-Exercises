# Iterating and concatenating all matches
# Now that you have a list of filenames to load, 
# you can load all the files into a list of DataFrames that can then be concatenated.

# Create an empty list: frames
frames = []

#  Iterate over csv_files
for csv in csv_files:

    #  Read csv into a DataFrame: df
    df = pd.read_csv(csv)
    
    # Append df to frames
    frames.append(df)

# Concatenate frames into a single DataFrame: uber
uber = pd.concat(frames)

# Print the shape of uber
print(uber.shape)

# Print the head of uber
print(uber.head())
