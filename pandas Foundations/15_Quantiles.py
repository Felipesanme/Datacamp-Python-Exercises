# Quantiles
# In this exercise, you'll investigate the probabilities of life expectancy in countries around the world. This dataset contains life expectancy for persons born each year from 1800 to 2015. Since country names change or results are not reported, not every country has values. This dataset was obtained from Gapminder. https://docs.google.com/a/continuum.io/spreadsheets/d/1dgOdlUEq6_V55OHZCxz5BG_0uoghJTeA6f83br5peNs/pub?range=A1:D70&gid=1&output=html#

# Print the number of countries reported in 2015
print(df['2015'].count())

# Print the 5th and 95th percentiles
print(df.quantile([0.05, 0.95]))

# Generate a box plot
years = ['1800', '1850', '1900', '1950', '2000']
df[years].plot(kind='box')
plt.show()
