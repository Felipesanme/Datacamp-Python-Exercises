# You can now flexibly chain together resampling and rolling operations. In this exercise, the same weather data from the previous exercises has been pre-loaded for you. Your job is to extract one month of data, resample to find the daily high temperatures, and then use a rolling and aggregation operation to smooth the data

# Extract the August 2010 data: august
august = df['Temperature']['2010-August']

# Resample to daily data, aggregating by max: daily_highs
daily_highs = august.resample('D').max()

# Use a rolling 7-day window with method chaining to smooth the daily high temperatures in August
daily_highs_smoothed = daily_highs.rolling(window=7).mean()
print(daily_highs_smoothed)
