#  In this exercise, a list of temperature data and a list of date strings has been pre-loaded for you as temperature_list and date_list respectively. Your job is to use the .to_datetime() method to build a DatetimeIndex out of the list of date strings, and to then use it along with the list of temperature data to build a pandas Series.

# Prepare a format string: time_format
time_format='%Y-%m-%d %H:%M'

# Convert date_list into a datetime object: my_datetimes
my_datetimes = pd.to_datetime(date_list, format=time_format)

# Construct a pandas Series using temperature_list and my_datetimes: time_series
time_series = pd.Series(temperature_list, index=my_datetimes)
