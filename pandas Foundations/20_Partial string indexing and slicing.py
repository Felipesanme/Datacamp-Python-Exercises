#  In this exercise, a time series that contains hourly weather data has been pre-loaded for you. This data was read using the parse_dates=True option in read_csv() with index_col="Dates" so that the Index is indeed a DatetimeIndex.

# All data from the 'Temperature' column has been extracted into the variable ts0. Your job is to use a variety of natural date strings to extract one or more values from ts0.

# Extract the hour from 9pm to 10pm on '2010-10-11': ts1
ts1 = ts0.loc['2010-10-11 21:00:00':'2010-10-11 22:00:00']

# Extract '2010-07-04' from ts0: ts2
ts2 = ts0.loc['2010-07-04']

# Extract data from '2010-12-15' to '2010-12-31': ts3
ts3 = ts0.loc['2010-12-15':'2010-12-31']
