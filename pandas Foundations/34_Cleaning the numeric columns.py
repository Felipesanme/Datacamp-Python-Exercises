# The pandas function pd.to_numeric() is ideal for this purpose: It converts a Series of values to floating-point values. Furthermore, by specifying the keyword argument errors='coerce', you can force strings like 'M' to be interpreted as NaN. A DataFrame df_clean is provided for you at the start of the exercise, and as usual, pandas has been imported as pd.

# Print the dry_bulb_faren temperature between 8 AM and 9 AM on June 20, 2011
print(df_clean.loc['2011-6-20 8:00:00':'2011-6-20 9:00:00', 'dry_bulb_faren'])

# Convert the dry_bulb_faren column to numeric values: df_clean['dry_bulb_faren']
df_clean['dry_bulb_faren'] = pd.to_numeric(
    df_clean['dry_bulb_faren'], errors='coerce')

# Print the transformed dry_bulb_faren temperature between 8 AM and 9 AM on June 20, 2011
print(df_clean.loc['2011-6-20 8:00:00':'2011-6-20 9:00:00', 'dry_bulb_faren'])

# Convert the wind_speed and dew_point_faren columns to numeric values
df_clean['wind_speed'] = pd.to_numeric(df_clean['wind_speed'], errors='coerce')
df_clean['dew_point_faren'] = pd.to_numeric(
    df_clean['dew_point_faren'], errors='coerce')
