# Your job is to use partial string indexing of the dates, in a variety of datetime string formats, to plot all the summer data and just one week of data together. After you are done, you can cycle between the two plots by clicking on the 'Previous Plot' and 'Next Plot' buttons.

# First, remind yourself how to extract one month of temperature data using 'May 2010' as a key into df.Temperature[], and call head() to inspect the result: df.Temperature['May 2010'].head().

# Plot the summer data
df.Temperature['2010-Jun':'2010-Aug'].plot()
plt.show()
plt.clf()

# Plot the one week data
df.Temperature['2010-06-10':'2010-06-17'].plot()
plt.show()
plt.clf()
