{"cells":[{"source":"## 1. Loading the NIPS papers\n<p>The NIPS conference (Neural Information Processing Systems) is one of the most prestigious yearly events in the machine learning community. At each NIPS conference, a large number of research papers are published. Over 50,000 PDF files were automatically downloaded and processed to obtain a dataset on various machine learning techniques. These NIPS papers are stored in <code>datasets/papers.csv</code>. The CSV file contains information on the different NIPS papers that were published from 1987 until 2017 (30 years!). These papers discuss a wide variety of topics in machine learning, from neural networks to optimization methods and many more.\n<img src=\"https://assets.datacamp.com/production/project_158/img/nips_logo.png\" alt=\"The logo of NIPS (Neural Information Processing Systems)\"></p>\n<p>First, we will explore the CSV file to determine what type of data we can use for the analysis and how it is structured. A research paper typically consists of a title, an abstract and the main text. Other data such as figures and tables were not extracted from the PDF files. Each paper discusses a novel technique or improvement. In this analysis, we will focus on analyzing these papers with natural language processing methods.</p>","cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"deletable":false,"editable":false,"tags":["context"],"dc":{"key":"4"},"run_control":{"frozen":true}}},{"source":"# Importing modules\n# -- YOUR CODE HERE --\nimport pandas as pd\n# Read datasets/papers.csv into papers\npapers = pd.read_csv('datasets/papers.csv')\n\n# Print out the first rows of papers\n# -- YOUR CODE HERE --\npapers.head()","cell_type":"code","outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","metadata":{},"execution_count":102,"data":{"text/plain":"     id  year                                              title event_type  \\\n0     1  1987  Self-Organization of Associative Database and ...

Preprocessing the text data\n<p>Let's now analyze the titles of the different papers to identify machine learning trends.
